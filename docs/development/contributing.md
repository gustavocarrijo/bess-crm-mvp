# Contributing to CRM Norr Energia

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CRM Norr Energia! This guide will help you set up your development environment, understand our coding standards, and submit changes effectively.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js 18+** (LTS version recommended)
- **PostgreSQL 15+**
- **Git**
- **Text editor** (VS Code recommended with official extensions)

### Initial Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork locally**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CRM Norr Energia.git
   cd CRM Norr Energia
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Copy environment file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. **Configure environment variables** (see [Configuration Reference](../admin/configuration.md) for details):
   ```bash
   # Edit .env with your settings
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/CRM Norr Energia
   AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here-min-32
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
   SMTP_USER=your-smtp-user
   SMTP_PASSWORD=your-smtp-password
   ```

6. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit migrate
   ```

7. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Environment Variables

Key environment variables (see [Configuration Reference](../admin/configuration.md) for complete list):

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | Yes |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Secret for JWT signing | Yes |
| `SMTP_HOST` | SMTP server for emails | No* |
| `SMTP_USER` | SMTP username | No* |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | SMTP password | No* |

*Required for email verification. Optional if email features not needed.

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch** from `master`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** with clear, atomic commits

3. **Run tests** to ensure nothing breaks:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. **Run linting** to catch code quality issues:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

5. **Push your branch and create a pull request** on GitHub

6. **Wait for review** from maintainers

7. **Address feedback** and make necessary changes

8. **Squash and merge** when approved

## Pull Request Process

When submitting a pull request:

1. **Fill out the PR template** completely
2. **Include**:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Testing steps reviewers should follow
   - Screenshots for UI changes
3. **Link related issues** (e.g., "Fixes #123")
4. **Ensure all tests pass** (`npm test`)
5. **Ensure linting passes** (`npm run lint`)
6. **Wait for review** - a maintainer will review your code
7. **Address feedback** - make requested changes

PRs are reviewed as quickly as possible, typically within 2-3 business days.

## Coding Standards

CRM Norr Energia follows strict TypeScript conventions to ensure code quality and maintainability:

- **TypeScript strict mode** enabled
- **Explicit return types** for functions
- **ESLint configuration** enforced (see [Code Style Guide](./code-style.md))
- **Prettier formatting** for consistent code style
- **Component patterns**:
  - Server components by default
  - Client components only when needed (`'use client'` directive)

See the [Code Style Guide](./code-style.md) for detailed conventions and patterns.

## Testing Requirements

All contributions should include appropriate tests:

- **Unit tests** for utilities and business logic
- **Integration tests** for critical paths
- **Run existing tests** before submitting PR (`npm test`)
- **Add tests** for new features

See the [Testing Guide](./testing.md) for detailed testing instructions.

## Documentation

Help us keep documentation up to date:

- **Update docs** when changing features
- **Keep code comments minimal** but helpful (comment *why*, not *what*)
- **Update README.md** if user-facing changes occur
- **Update API docs** if changing REST API

Documentation lives in the `docs/` directory organized by audience (user, API, admin, development).

## Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clear commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependencies

**Examples:**

```
feat(deals): add bulk delete action
fix(auth): correct email validation regex
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Questions?

- **Open an issue** for bug reports or feature requests
- **Check existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
- **Use discussions** for questions before opening issues

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to your pull requests!
