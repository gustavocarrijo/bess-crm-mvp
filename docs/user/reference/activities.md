# Activities Reference

Complete reference for the Activities feature in CRM Norr Energia. Activities track tasks, calls, meetings, and emails for follow-ups.

## Overview

### Key Concepts

- Activities have four types: Call, Meeting, Task, Email
- Each activity has a due date and optional time
- Activities can be linked to deals for context
- Overdue activities are highlighted for attention
- Calendar view provides a timeline perspective
