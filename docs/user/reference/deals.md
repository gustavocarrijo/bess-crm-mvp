# Deals Reference

Complete reference for the Deals feature in CRM Norr Energia. Deals represent sales opportunities tracked through your pipeline stages.

### Key Concepts

- Deals exist within pipeline stages
- Each deal must be linked to an organization and/or person
- Deals can have activities (calls, meetings, tasks) associated with them
- Deal values contribute to pipeline forecasting
- Custom fields extend deals with business-specific data
