# People Reference

Complete reference for the People (Contacts) feature in CRM Norr Energia. People represent individual contacts within organizations.

## Overview

People are individual contacts in CRM Norr Energia. They represent the human connections within organizations — the people you talk to, email, and build relationships with.

### Key Concepts

- People are contacts associated with (or independent of) organizations
- Each person can be linked to one organization
- People can be associated with multiple deals
- Activities can be linked to people through deals

---

## Best Practices

1. **Complete profiles** — Add email and phone when available
2. **Link to organizations** — Provides context and navigation
3. **Use consistent naming** — Helps with search and display
4. **Add notes for context** — Remember important details about contacts
5. **Keep data current** — Update when contact information changes

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Person appears twice | Check if duplicate; merge by reassigning deals, then delete |
| Organization not showing | Verify organization exists and isn't deleted |
| Email already exists | Multiple people can share emails — this is allowed |
| Can't find person | Use global search (`/` key) with partial name |
