# Pipelines & Kanban Reference

Complete reference for the Pipelines and Kanban Board features in CRM Norr Energia. Pipelines define your sales process stages; Kanban boards visualize deals through those stages.

## Overview

Pipelines define the stages a deal moves through from creation to close. The Kanban board provides a visual representation of all deals organized by their current stage.

### Key Concepts

- Pipelines contain ordered stages
- Each stage represents a step in your sales process
- Deals move between stages as they progress
- Special "Won" and "Lost" stages mark closed deals
- Kanban board shows deals as cards in stage columns

---

## Pipeline Structure

### Pipeline Components

A pipeline consists of:

1. **Active Stages**: The main progression steps (e.g., "New", "Qualified", "Proposal")
2. **Won Stage**: Successfully closed deals (terminal)
3. **Lost Stage**: Deals that didn't close (terminal)

### Stage Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Stage display name |
| **Color** | Visual indicator for the stage |
| **Position** | Order in the pipeline (left to right) |
| **Pipeline** | Which pipeline the stage belongs to |
| **Is Won?** | Whether this is the "Won" terminal stage |
| **Is Lost?** | Whether this is the "Lost" terminal stage |

### Terminal Stages

Each pipeline has exactly one Won and one Lost stage:
- **Won**: Deals that successfully closed
- **Lost**: Deals that didn't close
- These stages appear in a collapsed footer in the kanban view
- Moving a deal to Won/Lost marks it as closed

---

## Default Pipeline

CRM Norr Energia creates a default pipeline during setup:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| New | Newly created deals |
| Contacted | Initial contact made |
| Qualified | Lead qualified |
| Proposal | Proposal sent |
| Negotiation | Terms being negotiated |
| Won | Deal closed successfully |
| Lost | Deal did not close |

Administrators can customize stages at any time.

## Kanban Board

### Overview

The kanban board is the primary interface for viewing and managing deals:

- **Columns** = Stages (left to right, in order)
- **Cards** = Individual deals
- **Movement** = Drag cards between columns

## Best Practices

1. **Keep stages simple** — 5-7 stages is usually optimal
2. **Clear stage names** — Use names that reflect your actual process
3. **Consistent colors** — Use colors that match your workflow semantics
4. **Move deals promptly** — Keep pipeline current
5. **Archive old deals** — Move stuck deals to Lost to keep pipeline clean

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Pipeline not showing | Check if pipeline exists; verify permissions |
| Can't drag deal | Check if deal is in terminal stage |
| Wrong stage order | Contact admin to reorder stages |
| Missing Won/Lost stages | Each pipeline has exactly one of each; contact admin |
