- **Deals**: Filter by pipeline, stage

### Activities Filtering

#### Filter by Type

Select from the Type dropdown:
- All Types
- Calls
- Meetings
- Tasks
- Emails

#### Filter by Status

Toggle between:
- **Pending**: Activities not yet completed
- **Completed**: Finished activities
- **All**: Everything

#### Filter by Date Range

Date filter options:

- **Today**: Due today
- **This Week**: Due within current week
- **Custom Range**: Select specific dates

#### Overdue Section

Overdue activities automatically appear in a highlighted section at the top of the list, ensuring critical follow-ups aren't missed.

### Deals Filtering

#### Filter by Pipeline

If multiple pipelines exist:
1. Use the pipeline selector in the header
2. Select the pipeline to view
3. Kanban board updates to show that pipeline's deals

#### Filter by Stage

## URL-Based Filters

### How It Works

Filter selections are saved in the URL:

```
/activities?type=call&status=pending&date=this_week
/deals?pipeline=uuid-here
```

2. **Bookmarks**: Save common filter combinations
3. **Back Button**: Return to previous filter state
4. **Direct Navigation**: Type URL with parameters

### URL Parameters

| Page | Parameter | Values |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Activities | `type` | call, meeting, task, email |
| Activities | `status` | pending, completed, all |
| Activities | `overdue` | true, false |
| Deals | `pipeline` | Pipeline UUID |

## Search Tips

### Effective Queries

- **Partial matches work**: "Acme" finds "Acme Corporation"
- **Case-insensitive**: "john" finds "John Smith"
- **Email search**: Search by domain ("@company.com")
- **Multiple words**: Searches each word separately

### When to Use Search

| Need | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Find specific record | Global search (`/`) |
| Browse filtered list | Use list filters |
| Find related records | Navigate from detail pages |
| Recent items | Check recent activity |

---

## Search Debouncing

Search uses 300ms debouncing to balance:
- Responsiveness (results appear quickly)
- Server load (not querying on every keystroke)
- User experience (no flickering results)

Type steadily — results appear after you pause briefly.

---

## Match Highlighting

### How It Works

- Matching text has yellow background
- Highlights appear in dropdown results
- Makes it easy to identify why a result matched

### Example

Search: "john"

Results show:
- **John** Smith (match in first name)
- Mary **John**son (match in last name)
- **john**@company.com (match in email)

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No results found | Check spelling; try partial matches |
| Search too slow | Wait for debounce; check network |
| Results not relevant | Try more specific query |
| Can't find record | Record may be deleted; check with admin |
| Filter won't apply | Clear filters and try again |

## Best Practices

1. **Use keyboard shortcut** — `/` is faster than clicking
2. **Type partial names** — Often sufficient to find results
3. **Use filters for lists** — Better than search for browsing
4. **Share filtered URLs** — Help teammates see same view
5. **Clear filters when done** — Avoid confusion later
